- 👋 Hi, I’m @flyingbatcatpossum, a self-proclaimed professional 
- 👀 I’m interested in absolutely nothing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become a paper-kite professional tester
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to not be social
- 📫 How to reach me with telepathy
- 😄 Pronouns: are not required because you will not talk to me
- ⚡ Fun fact: are fun until they are not

- Here is a little something that my uncle Clorince Gaspard Pierrick Thomson has told me recently,
- an espresso martini in his lefthand, and his black meowing chunky ferret on his right shoulder :
- "Believe in yourself, even when your shoes don't match and you accidentally put cereal in the fridge.
- Success is just one nap away, so keep going!
- Remember, even a broken clock is right twice a day—so you're probably ahead of schedule."

- Sometimes I think about it, and find some truth in those words. And I hope that someday, you will too.
